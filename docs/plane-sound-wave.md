# pressure in plane sound wave
It is modulated around ambient pressure $p_0$ and the difference to it is a longitudinal wave and also a solution of wave equation, e.g.

$$
\Delta p(x, y) = \Delta p_{\rm max} \sin (kx - \omega t + \varphi_0),
$$

where the amplitude is $\Delta p_{\rm max} = p - p_0$ with $p$ is the air pressure at certain position $x$ at time $t$.
