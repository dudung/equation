# fick's first law
It relates the diffusive flux to the gradient of the concentration, which postulates the flux goes from regions of high concentration to regions of low cencentration, with a magnitude that is proportional to the concentration gradient or spatial derivative, as follow

$$
\vec{J} = - D \vec{\nabla} \varphi,
$$

where $\vec{J}$ is diffusion flux vector, $D$ is diffusion coefficient or diffusivity, and $\varphi$ is concentration, with their dimensions are amount of substance per unit area per unit time, area per unit time, and amount of substrance per unit volume, respectively.
