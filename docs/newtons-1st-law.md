# newton's first law
It states that every object will remain at rest or in uniform motion in a straight lines unless compelled to change its state by the action of an external force

$$
\vec{F} = 0 \Rightarrow \frac{d \vec{v}}{dt} = 0
$$

where the external force $\vec{F}$ might be sum of all forces, $\sum \vec{F}$, considered to work on the object.
