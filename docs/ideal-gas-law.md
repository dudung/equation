# ideal gas law
It is the equation of state of a hypothetical gas, which relates gas pressure $p$, volume $V$, temperature $T$, and amount of substance $n$ in the form of

$$
pV = nRT,
$$

where $R = 8.314 \ {\rm J \cdot mol^{-1} \cdot K^{-1}}$ is universal gas constant, the unit of $p$, $V$, $n$, and $T$ are ${\rm N/m^2}$, ${\rm m^3}$, ${\rm mol}$, and ${\rm K}$.
