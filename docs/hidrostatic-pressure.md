# hidrostatic pressure
It is the pressure that is exerted by fluid at equilibrium at a given point within the fluid, due to the force of gravity, e.g.

$$
p_2 = p_1 + \rho g (y_1 - y_2),
$$

where $p_i$ and $y_i$ are pressure and elevation at point $i$, respectively, with $i = 1, 2$, $\rho$ is fluid density, and $g$ is acceleration due to gravity. Positive direction of $y$ is in opposite direction of $g$.
