# fick's second law
It predicts how diffusion causes the concentration to change with respect to time in the form of

$$
\frac{\partial \varphi}{\partial t} = D \nabla^2 \varphi,
$$

where $\varphi$ is concentration, $t$ is time, $D$ is diffusion coefficient or diffusivity, and $\nabla^2$ is the Laplacian, with their dimensions are amount of substrance per unit volume, time, area per unit time, and per unit area, respectively.
