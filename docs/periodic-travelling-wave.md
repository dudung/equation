# periodic travelling wave
It is periodic function that moves with constant speed and has been known as the solution of the wave equation, e.g.

$$
y(x, t) = A \sin(kx - \omega t + \varphi_0)
$$

is for a transverse wave motion as on a string, where oscillation motion of $y$ is always perpendicular to the direction of phase propagation along $x$ direction.
