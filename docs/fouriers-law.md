# fourier's law
It is the first law of heat conduction, known as Forier's law, states that the flux heat in a homogenous body is in the direction of, and proportional to, the temperature gradient

\begin{equation}\tag{1}\label{fouriers-law}
\vec{q}_h = - \kappa \vec{\nabla} T,
\end{equation}

where $q_h$ is the thermal flux, $\kappa$ is thermal conductivity, and $\vec{\nabla} T$ is the spatial gradient of temperature $T$ [1]. Unit of $\vec{q}_h$ is ${\rm W} \cdot {\rm m}^{-2}$, of $\kappa$ is ${\rm W} \cdot {\rm m}^{-1} \cdot {\rm K}^{-1}$, and of $\vec{\nabla} T$ is ${\rm K} \cdot {\rm m}^{-1}$ [2].
