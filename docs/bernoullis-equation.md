# bernoulli's equation
It impelements Bernoulli's principle, which states that an increase in the speed of a fluid occurs simultaneously with a decrease in static pressure or a decrease in the fluid's potential, in the form of

$$
\tfrac12 \rho v^2 + \rho g y + p = c,
$$

where $\rho$ is density of the fluid at all points in the fluid, $v$ is fluid flow at a point, $g$ is acceleration due to gravity, $y$ is elevation of the point above a reference plan with positive direction is in the opposite direction of $g$, $p$ is a pressure the chosen point, and $c$ is a constant.
