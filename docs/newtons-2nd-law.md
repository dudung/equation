# newton's second law
It is a quantitative description of the changes that a force can produce on motion of a body, where it defines a force to be equal to change of momentum per change time

$$
\vec{F} = \frac{d\vec{p}}{dt},
$$

where the force $\vec{F}$ might be sum of all forces, $\sum \vec{F}$, considered to work on the body.
