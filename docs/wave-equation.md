# wave equation
It is a linear second-order patial differential equation which describes the propagation of oscillations at fixed speed $v$ in some quantity $\psi$ in the form of

$$
\nabla^2 \psi - \frac{1}{v^2} \frac{\partial^2 \psi}{\partial t^2} = 0,
$$

where $\psi$ can be any physical quantity, $t$ is time, and $\nabla^2$ is the Laplacian.
